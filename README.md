# Hive_CaseStudy
This assignment aims at testing your skills in Hive, and Hadoop concepts learned throughout this course. Similar to Big Data Analysts, you will be required to extract the data, load them into Hive tables, and gather insights from the dataset.

# Problem Statement
With online sales gaining popularity, tech companies are exploring ways to improve their sales by analysing customer behaviour and gaining insights about product trends. Furthermore, the websites make it easier for customers to find the products they require without much scavenging. Needless to say, the role of big data analysts is among the most sought-after job profiles of this decade. Therefore, as part of this assignment, we will be challenging you, as a big data analyst, to extract data and gather insights from a real-life data set of an e-commerce company.
